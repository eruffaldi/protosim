Protocol Format:
- use variable size id and size for making it flexible
- variable size is easy in simulink, just make vector of constant for id

Simulink Decoder:
- cannot work with variable size udp packet
- cannot compute parameter of udp block automatically
- solution: pick list of id (and sizes) and spit out data for id and its associated enabler, then attach a decoder with exact size
    semantics: discard all replicated id or if multiple specified ...
