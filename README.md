------------------------------------------------------------------------

Specification language and tool for data exchange between Matlab/Simulink, XVR and Python. In particular the tool generates wrapper for de/serialization in Simulink. The protocol emerged as the need of creating a way for exchanging data between XVR, Simulink and Python for real-time data processing.  Examples of protocols as used in the SPRINT rowing systems are provided www.percro.org/sprint/

genproto.py is the tool
row_protos.py are the examples
protorec contains recorder and store tool
